# Sourced by the PC scripts after scripts/lib/device.sh (DEVICE, OUT): where the Echo's binaries in build/<codename>/
# come from.  Built here (make: the Android NDK and the unpacked firmware), or the release CI published of this very
# commit: hassmic-<codename>.bundle, checked against keys/release.pub and unpacked by scripts/otatool.py, so nothing
# has to be installed or compiled for it.  It is what online updates install, the same files byte for byte.
#   PREBUILT=1    the release's; stop if this commit has none
#   PREBUILT=0    always build
#   (unset)       build where the NDK is there, else the release's
# $OUT/PREBUILT marks a release's files there: "<tag> <commit> <version>", then their names.  A build here removes them
# first, or make would take the downloaded binaries (newer than the sources) as up to date.

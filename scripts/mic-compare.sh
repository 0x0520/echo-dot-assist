# Records what the microphones deliver (micRaw) and what Amazon's front end makes of it (micAsr, the stream the wake
# word and the voice pipeline get) at the same time on an installed Echo, without stopping hassmic, and compares speech
# against noise in both (tools/mic-compare.py).  This is how the missing listening mode was found (PLAN.md, 2026-09-30):
# the front end took a quiet sentence away after 1.5 s that the microphones still had.
#   scripts/mic-compare.sh [-l] [seconds]      default 15 s; say one sentence when it prints GO, then stay silent
#   -l   put the front end into listening mode for the recording, as hassmic does while a command is spoken
# micAsr comes from hassmic's own dump (SIGTTIN -> state/capture.raw): the mixer gives that stream to one client only.
# micRaw can be read beside it (one channel, whatever is asked for).  Results in device-logs/mic-compare-<time>/.

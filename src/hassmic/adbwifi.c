/*
 * adb over Wi-Fi is a root shell without a password (the unlock turns adbd's key check off), so an installed Echo keeps
 * it closed: lockdown.sh runs adbd without its TCP listener and takes stock's firewall rule for port 5555 out.  For
 * debugging it can be opened for half an hour from Home Assistant.  hassmic is unprivileged and faces the network, so as
 * with push updates (ota.c) it only asks: a request file in state/, which root's firewall watcher takes within 5 s.  How
 * long the window lasts and when it ends is that side's business (a reboot always ends it); it answers with the file
 * adb-open in a directory only root writes, which exists exactly while the port is open.
 * A request names the one address to admit when it can: whoever signed the push port's challenge (ota.c) gets the port
 * for their own address only, not the whole network.  The switch in Home Assistant names none (the connection that
 * flips it is Home Assistant's, not the developer's PC): root admits the network then, or what ADB_WIFI_FROM in
 * hassmic.conf says.  Root checks the address again before it goes into a firewall rule.

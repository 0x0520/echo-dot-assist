/* The alarm clock: alarms that ring on the Echo itself, also while Home Assistant or the network is down (alarms.c).
 *
 * The Echo has no clock of its own to go by once it is locked down (no NTP, egress firewalled, and whether its RTC
 * keeps the time over a reboot is not known), so the wall clock is Home Assistant's: asked for over the ESPHome API
 * when it connects and every hour, and kept as an offset to the kernel's boot clock, which runs on through Home
 * Assistant going away.  hassmic restarting (an update, a crash) keeps it: the offset is saved with the kernel's boot id.
 * After a reboot there is none until Home Assistant has answered, and until then no alarm rings, rather than at a wrong
 * time.  Everything below takes core_lock's protection: called with it held, except alarms_init. */

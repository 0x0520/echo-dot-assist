/* Noise reduction for the mic audio sent to the voice pipeline: RNNoise (src/third_party/rnnoise, v0.1.1), ahead of the
 * gain (micgain.h).  Not for the wake word, whose model is tuned to the stock stream.
 *
 * Why: even with the front end in listening mode a quietly spoken command sits only 6-8 dB over the noise floor of
 * micAsr (-65 dBFS; captures of 2026-09-30), and the gain lifts that floor with the speech to about -32 dBFS.  Amazon's
 * ASR path has no noise reduction of its own (AFE.cfg: the NoiseReductor belongs to the VoIP path). */

/* Automatic gain for the pipeline's mic audio: see micgain.h.
 *
 * Per 10 ms frame: a floor tracker (follows drops at once, rises 3 dB/s); frames 9 dB above the floor count as speech
 * and feed the talker's active speech level: the power mean over speech frames only (pauses left out), like ITU-T P.56,
 * averaged over ~0.5 s.  The gain brings that level to the target, so the slider's value is what the pipeline gets.
 *
 * Not an upper envelope of the frames, as first written: how far such an envelope sits above the active level depends on
 * how peaky the speech is, +4 dB on the synthetic syllables of the unit test, -7 to +2 dB on the Echo's captures, so no
 * fixed offset could make the slider mean the output level.  A power mean needs no attack of its own: frames 20 dB
 * over it lift the mean by 5 dB each, 13 dB within 100 ms.  A capture that starts cold (no wake word to start from) with
 * its loudest word and fades by 15 dB within 2.5 s still ends up 6 dB under the target.
 *
 * The gain falls at once but rises only during speech and at 12 dB/s, so pauses and the room never pump up.  A peak
 * limiter per frame keeps loud close speech from clipping while the level catches up. */

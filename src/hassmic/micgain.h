/* Automatic gain for the mic audio sent to the voice pipeline (not for the wake word, which is tuned to the stock level).
 *
 * Amazon's ASR path (AFE.cfg) ends in a fixed +5.2 dB "ASR Output Gain": no AGC, its cloud ASR was trained on that level.
 * Spoken wake words arrive at -50 to -62 dBFS (keyword rms, 10 detections on the installed Echo, 2026-09-29) over a
 * -67 dBFS floor; the STT engines and Home Assistant's VAD expect speech around -25 dBFS, as the Voice PE sends it.
 * Home Assistant does not help: its ESPHome satellite drops the audio settings of the request (core, assist_satellite
 * entity.py builds AudioSettings with silence_seconds only), so gain has to happen here. */
